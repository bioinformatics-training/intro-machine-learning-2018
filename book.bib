abstract="High content screening (HCS) is a powerful method for the exploration of cellular signalling and morphology that is rapidly being adopted in cancer research. HCS uses automated microscopy to collect images of cultured cells. The images are subjected to segmentation algorithms to identify cellular structures and quantitate their morphology, for hundreds to millions of individual cells. However, image analysis may be imperfect, especially for ``HCS-unfriendly'' cell lines whose morphology is not well handled by current image segmentation algorithms. We asked if segmentation errors were common for a clinically relevant cell line, if such errors had measurable effects on the data, and if HCS data could be improved by automated identification of well-segmented cells.",

  abstract = {Leaf senescence is an essential developmental process that impacts dramatically on crop yields and involves altered regulation of thousands of genes and many metabolic and signaling pathways, resulting in major changes in the leaf. The regulation of senescence is complex, and although senescence regulatory genes have been characterized, there is little information on how these function in the global control of the process. We used microarray analysis to obtain a high-resolution time-course profile of gene expression during development of a single leaf over a 3-week period to senescence. A complex experimental design approach and a combination of methods were used to extract high-quality replicated data and to identify differentially expressed genes. The multiple time points enable the use of highly informative clustering to reveal distinct time points at which signaling and metabolic pathways change. Analysis of motif enrichment, as well as comparison of transcription factor (TF) families showing altered expression over the time course, identify clear groups of TFs active at different stages of leaf development and senescence. These data enable connection of metabolic processes, signaling pathways, and specific TF activity, which will underpin the development of network models to elucidate the process of senescence.},

    abstract = {Water availability is the biggest single limitation on plant productivity worldwide. In Arabidopsis, changes in metabolism and gene expression drive increased drought tolerance and initiate diverse drought avoidance and escape responses. To address regulatory processes that link these responses together, we set out to identify novel genes that govern early responses to drought. To do this, a high-resolution time series transcriptomics dataset was produced, coupled with detailed physiological and metabolic analyses of plants subjected to a slow transition from well-watered to drought conditions. 1815 drought-responsive differentially expressed genes were identified. The major early changes in gene expression coincided with a drop in carbon assimilation, and only in the late stages with an increase in foliar abscisic acid content. In order to identify gene regulatory networks (GRNs) mediating the transition between the early and late stages of drought, we used Bayesian network modelling of differentially expressed transcription factor (TF) genes. This approach identified AGAMOUS-LIKE22 as key hub gene in a TF GRN. It has previously been shown that AGL22 is involved in the transition from vegetative state to flowering but here we show that AGL22 expression influences steady state photosynthetic rates and lifetime water use. This suggests that AGL22 uniquely regulates a transcriptional network during drought stress, linking changes in primary metabolism and the initiation of stress responses.},

    Abstract                 = {Identifying the set of genes differentially expressed along time is an important task in two-sample time course experiments. Furthermore, estimating at which time periods the differential expression is present can provide additional insight into the temporal gene functions. The current differential detection methods are designed to detect difference along observation time intervals or on single measurement points, warranting dense measurements along time to characterise the full temporal differential expression patterns.We propose a novel Bayesian likelihood ratio test to estimate the differential expression time periods. Applying the ratio test to systems of genes provides the temporal response timings and durations of gene expression to a biological condition. We introduce a novel non-stationary Gaussian process as the underlying expression model, with major improvements on model fitness on perturbation and stress experiments. The method is robust to uneven or sparse measurements along time. We assess the performance of the method on realistically simulated dataset and compare against state-of-the-art methods. We additionally apply the method to the analysis of primary human endothelial cells under an ionizing radiation stress to study the transcriptional perturbations over 283 measured genes in an attempt to better understand the role of endothelium in both normal and cancer tissues during radiotherapy. As a result, using the cascade of differential expression periods, domain literature and gene enrichment analysis, we gain insights into the dynamic response of endothelial cells to irradiation.
