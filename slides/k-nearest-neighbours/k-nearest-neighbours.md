=====================================================
![](img/knn_classification.svg)
***
Two classes: blue squares & red triangles

Test object: green circle

k=3: solid line circle

k=5: dashed line circle


k-NN characteristics
=====================================================
- simplest method of supervised learning we will cover in this course.
- non-parametric
- instance (memory) based learning, because all computation is deferred until prediction
- most computationally demanding aspects of knn are finding neighbours and storing the learning set


k-NN Regression example
